# Rails Baseball API
*Estimated time: 3-4 hours*

### Goal
Create an API in a Rails app that tracks baseball scores for a team and players.

_Each level gets harder and builds on the previous code. Please donâ€™t spend more than 4 hours._

#### Level 1
- Create an API in a Rails app. You can use [Rails::API](https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api), [Rails v5.0.0.rc1](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/v5.0.0.rc1), [Grape-Ruby API](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape), or roll your own.
- The app should have models for baseball players, their teams, games, and any other models you deem necessary to track scoring.

#### Level 2
- The API should be RESTful to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE data for the models. A user of the API should also be able to:
	- Get top scoring players
	- Get a ranked list of teams
	- Get a list of games with their scores

#### Level 3
- The API should cache responses, keep response data accurate and up to date, and keep response times minimal (under 150ms).

#### Level 4
- The API should paginate results for any list of objects. For example, a user of the API should be able to get a list of players at a path like `/api/players`, passing in params `per_page` and `page`, and get results paginated in the response body and pagination metadata in the response headers.

#### Level 5
- Each player should have a robust "player card". Players should have a photo and multiple videos associated with their profile.
- An API user should be able to "upload" photo and videos through the API for the player.

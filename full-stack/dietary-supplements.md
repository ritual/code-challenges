# Dietary Supplements App
*Estimated time: 6-8 hours*

## Goal
Create a full-stack that lists dietary supplements with a detail view. Use your choice of frameworks, or see the list of frameworks below for some ideas.

### Notes before you start
- The UI/UX is available in this folder for a desktop layout in both Sketch and PDF formats. You should also make it work gracefully on a mobile screen.
- Each level is designed to build on the previous one - it will get harder, don't feel an obligation to complete all levels. Just complete as much as you feel delivers the product you want to ship.
- Try not to go over the allotted time :)

### Level 1 (Server-side)
- You'll be creating an API that exposes data about dietary supplements. To do so, create models + endpoints that allow a client-side app to consume the data.
- The data regarding the dietary supplements will come from an API that the NIH provides (linked below). You will need to consume this data into your app, and structure it in a way that you can pass on to the client-side.

### Level 2 (Client-side)
- Create a list of supplements, with an expanded detail view that shows when selecting one. This should consume the API created in Level 1, and follow the design as shared in the related PDF and Sketch files.

### Level 3
- Add the ability to search ingredients by name.
- Bonus: Try searching ingredients by more than name?

### Level 4
- Add the ability to email a dietary supplement, with the contents in the body of the email.
